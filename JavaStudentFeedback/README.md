Features
Account Creation: The system enables administrators to create student accounts efficiently.

Feedback Submission: Students can submit feedback through the application, providing valuable insights to improve the educational experience.

Custom Validation Algorithm: An advanced validation algorithm is implemented, reducing errors during data entry by up to 80%. This ensures that the data entered is accurate and reliable.

Database Relationships: Primary and foreign key relationships are established between the registration and feedback databases. This enhances data integrity and security, preventing data anomalies and unauthorized access.
